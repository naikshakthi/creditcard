PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  Fraud detection involves monitoring the activities of 
populations of users in order to estimate, perceive or avoid 
objectionable behaviour, which consist of fraud, intrusion, and 
defaulting. This is a very relevant problem that demands the 
attention of communities such as machine learning and data 
science where the solution to this problem can be automated.
  
  This problem is particularly challenging from the perspective of 
learning, as it is characterized by various factors such as class 
imbalance. The number of valid transactions far outnumber 
fraudulent ones. Also, the transaction patterns often change 
their statistical properties over the course of time

INTRODUCTION:
  It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. This data set presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the data set The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise
